LUMINATE Midyear MUSIC REPORT / 2025 INTRODUCTION Midway through 2025, our focus at Luminate remains squarely on the intersection of growth and disruption
within the music industry. Undoubtedly, the past six months have already delivered an abundance of both.
From Los Angeles to Tokyo, New York to London and everywhere the music industry operates, two
questions consistently emerge: Where is the next wave of growth coming from, and is AI an enabler or a
Introduction
disruptor in this evolving landscape? Our 2025 Midyear Music Report directly addresses the first question
and sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the second.


Luminate’s operational scope has expanded dramatically in just four years. Following extensive investment,
our technology now processes over 30 trillion data points across more than 200 million recordings,
spanning more than 60 markets and, in some cases, analyzing data that extends back beyond three
decades. In an industry increasingly driven by data and constantly seeking to understand future trends,
Luminate provides an unparalleled solution for our global customers and partners. As AI technologies
become more deeply integrated into every facet of our lives and businesses, accurate and actionable data
stands as the crucial differentiator for any business aiming to navigate this complex future.


With an industry narrative of slowing growth in streaming, our data confirms a deceleration in growth for
both U.S. and Global On-Demand Audio streaming. U.S. streaming grew by 5% and global streaming by 10%,
compared to 8% and 15% respectively in 2024. However, our Midyear Music Report identifies numerous
opportunities for continued diversification and growth across the industry. For example, the evolving
interplay of generations, genres and growth is clearly demonstrated by the resurgence of the
Christian/Gospel genre. This multifaceted trend is fueled by its artistic evolution, enhanced accessibility
through digital platforms, influence of modern worship movements, rise of powerful subgenres such as
Christian Hip-Hop and a growing consumer demand for authentic content.


In 2022, Luminate significantly expanded its global music coverage to 48 countries, a number that is now
over 60 with the recent addition of key markets across the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Our bet that music would become more global than ever in 2025 is validated through our Export Power
Rankings. Comparing rapidly expanding markets such as the Middle East and Africa with Latin America, the
data highlights distinct regional trends. Nigeria and Brazil show strong local consumption, with 61% and 75%
of streams, respectively, originating from local artists. Conversely, Ghana and Bolivia are most receptive to
regional imports in their area, at 25% and 65%, respectively, while markets including the UAE and Peru see a
significant portion of their streams (92% and 36%) from artists outside their region.


In 2025, Luminate further extended its coverage to include musical activity within gaming environments,
initially launching with Epic Games. The music industry has long identified gaming as a significant growth
opportunity, and the sector is eager to highlight its importance to artists and labels. Luminate is uniquely
positioned to narrate this trend, and we look forward to collaborating with more gaming partners in the
coming quarters.

--- PAGE 4 ---
LUMINATE Midyear MUSIC REPORT / 2025 INTRODUCTION As the integration of Luminate’s data across music, film and television continues, we are uncovering more
and more examples of transmedia impact. The transmedia opportunity represents the strategic advantage
of telling a unified story, or brand building, across multiple distinct media platforms, with each uniquely
contributing to the overall narrative experience. Among the many instances observed in 2025, Led Zeppelin
and LISA stand out. The documentary Becoming Led Zeppelin, streaming on Netflix, emerged as the year’s
top music documentary so far, driving a sustained 23% increase in the band’s streaming over four months.
Similarly, Thai artist LISA recently starred as Mook in Season 3 of HBO’s The White Lotus. The show’s release
coincided with LISA’s Alter Ego album launch, introducing her to new audiences as her TV role attracted fans
to the series, particularly those interested in travel — a central theme of The White Lotus.


Finally, we turn to AI. Luminate data indicates that one in three U.S. music listeners express being
“somewhat” or “very” comfortable with the use of generative AI to create song instrumentals, with younger
audiences showing even higher comfort levels. While 44% report discomfort with generative AI creating new
original songs performed by an AI voice, listeners of certain genres, such as EDM and K-pop, are notably
more open to this practice. Currently, the emergence of artists including The Velvet Sundown and Aventhis
marks a pivotal and inherently controversial moment in the long history of technology’s influence on music.
Unlike previous technological advancements that primarily augmented human artistry or transformed
distribution, these acts appear to be fundamentally AI generated, directly challenging the very definition of
artistry itself. The historical trajectory of technology in music has predominantly been a narrative of
amplification and accessibility, from recording devices preserving sound to digital audio workstations
empowering creators and democratizing listening.
However, the significant streaming activity of artists such as The Velvet Sundown and Aventhis signifies a
new frontier where technology transcends its role as a mere tool to become a direct competitor. Their very
presence challenges existing economic models, legal frameworks and the foundational definitions of artistry
within the music industry. Their rise necessitates a critical examination of ownership, compensation,
authenticity and the future of human creativity in an increasingly AI-driven world. And the ongoing debate
surrounding them encompasses both the rapidly improving quality of their music and also the profound
existential and economic questions they pose for human artists. Look to Luminate in the coming months to
provide more clarity on the scale and impact of AI-generated music on the industry.


We often say that Luminate delivers facts, not opinions. While some of the observations in this report lean
into analysis, we appreciate you taking the time to review these insights. We’re confident they’ll prove
valuable as you navigate the data-driven music industry in the months ahead.
Be sure to let us know.

Recession Pop: It’s Not Just the Vibe That’s Back

New releases from artists such as Lady Gaga and Kesha fueled discussions of whether Recession Pop was back, but the data shows tracks released in the Great Recession era
are also having a resurgence.

When analyzing the growth of U.S. tracks released in the Great Recession of 2007-12, Pop songs from those years grew 6.4% in On-Demand Audio volume in 2025, outpacing the
U.S. industry’s rate of 4.6%. The corresponding Pop share point increase of all tracks released 2007-12 is also more than 2x that of the next closest genre, showing 2025 audiences
are gravitating to the Pop genre from this period.

Top 10 Countries in Global Export Power

As global digital service providers (DSPs) facilitate the spread of music across borders, there’s an opportunity to increase a country’s cultural impact through music in foreign territories
as well as identify clusters and analyze music trade relationships.

Luminate Export Power Rankings evaluate a country’s ability to export recorded music globally. This score is a combination of four data points: the rank of artists in each country based on
Total On-Demand Streaming and Country of Origin; the number of countries importing music from a given export country; the streaming size of importing countries; and the number of artists per
export country reaching international audiences.

Import/Export: Country of Origin

An analysis of streaming share that is local, regional and ex-regional artists helps to identify countries that are importers and exporters throughout specific regions. This aids in understanding how
music spreads globally, helps businesses identify relevant joint-venture relationships and answers such questions as which markets are the most insulated or native in their streaming behavior.

Streaming growth is slowing in mature Western markets, with U.S. On-Demand Audio growth
declining from 6.4% in 2024 to 4.6% so far in 2025. Still, this creates an opportunity to deepen
engagement and foster long-term loyalty with highly valuable consumers through innovation.
This section showcases Luminate insights on fan engagement across community platforms,

U.S. Fan Engagement Funnel

In Luminate’s most recent audience response data, 18% of U.S. music listeners are considered super fans, meaning they engage with artists and music in 5 or more ways. However, there are different
levels of fandom, and understanding where specific fan groups fit into the Fan Engagement Funnel helps marketers tailor activations and devise strategies to move fans closer to super fan status.

the past 18 months. The upshot: Q1 2025 marks the first instance in several years where future festival intent actually improved vs. the previous quarter among the average consumer.
