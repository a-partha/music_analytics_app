Luminate Export Power Rankings evaluate a country’s ability to export recorded music globally. This score is a combination of four data points: the rank of artists in each country based on
Total On-Demand Streaming and Country of Origin; the number of countries importing music from a given export country; the streaming size of importing countries; and the number of artists per
export country reaching international audiences.",,,,,,
